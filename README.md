# Hi, I'm Yannick KOUAKOU! 👋

I’m a passionate and curious software developer currently pursuing a Master's degree in Software Architecture at EPITECH Paris. I’m driven by a deep interest in how systems work under the hood, with a particular focus on system design, data structures, and building clean, efficient solutions. Always eager to learn and grow, I enjoy turning complex problems into elegant code, exploring new technologies, and contributing to open source projects as a way to both give back and sharpen my skills.
